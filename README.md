# React Gradient Card Component

## Overview

This project is a React application that displays a collection of reusable card components. Each card displays an image, title, and description, all of which are passed as props. The cards have a dynamic gradient border that changes every few seconds, providing a visually appealing effect.

## Features

- **Reusable Card Component**: The card component accepts props for title, description, and image URL, making it flexible for various content.
- **Dynamic Gradient Border**: The border of each card uses a gradient that changes every 3 seconds. All cards update simultaneously to the next gradient in the array, creating a synchronized animation effect.
- **Smooth Transition**: Uses CSS transitions for a smooth change between gradients, enhancing the visual appeal.
- **Responsive Layout**: The cards are arranged in a responsive layout, ensuring they look good on various screen sizes.
